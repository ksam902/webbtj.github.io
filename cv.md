#### Yesterday
I studied Web Development at NSCC, graduating in 2005 with the highest
aggregate with training in ASP.NET, VB.NET, Java, Flash, Director, JavaScript,
CSS, XHTML, and PHP.

In 2006 I began freelancing, lots of PHP, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript and a bit of
Flash and a smidgen of ASP to keep me on my toes. The work was sporadic,
I wasn't great at the business side (specifically charging enough), but it was
what I went to school for and was what I loved.

In 2007, while continuing to freelance, I took an *Application Specialist*
position with Kohltech Windows, primarily scripting for their order entry/sales
and bill-of-material software in VB.NET. I also worked with some reporting
software in C#, some VBA scripting, as well as work with some of the CNC
machines. This was also where my love of automation began and I started to
develop desktop software to automate some of my more *mundane* tasks.

#### Today
In late 2010 I moved on from both Kohltech and freelancing to join the wonderful
team at Norex. I started mainly on WordPress development. I'd switched from
Windows to OSX and Linux, .NET to PHP, and desktop to web as my nine-to-five
literally overnight.

Over the years at Norex I've worked up to the role of Lead Developer, as well as
served as CTO for Pursu.it, a crowdfunding platform I'd developed with the
Norex management team.

Today my role is very much a senior one. I lead initiatives in expanding our
technology stack(s), lead large scale client projects in a hybrid
developer/team lead/project manger role. I work with management and producers to
help develop and foster learning plans, and am heavily involved with our hiring
and co-op program.

I'm a learner. I love learning and figuring out new things. I've recently
completed a year long Coursera course in Data Science, I've been learning more
about building command line tools, and I just picked up Jekyll, Liquid,
Materialize, and SCSS to rebuild this site in a few evenings (pure static HTML
goodness).

#### Tomorrow
Having the opportunity to work with team members on their learning plans, being
able to be involved in our co-op program (working with both NSCC and Dalhousie
University), being given the opportunity to lead newer developers and share my
experiences. As much as I love building, creating, and problem solving, I
someday see myself moving to education. I want to continue to put more of my
time towards fostering the next generation of programmers. But, not quite yet,
I still have a lot of code I want to write.
