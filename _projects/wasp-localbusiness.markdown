## Installation and Usage

Installation is pretty straight-forward. Download a zip or pull the repo from
[GitHub](https://github.com/webbtj/wasp-localbusiness), extract, place in the
plugins directory and activate the plugin like normal. You'll also need the
Advanced Custom Fields
[Options Page add-on](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/add-ons/options-page/)
($25/USD, worth every penny if you're developing multiple client sites). Once
everything is installed you will now have a group of fields on your options page
dedicated to generating LocalBusiness Schema.org markup, including contact, map,
and hours information.
